## What is Node.js?

- **Node.js** is a JavaScript runtime built on the Chrome V8 JavaScript engine.
- Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source runtime environment maintained by the **OpenJS Foundation**.
- It allows JavaScript to run outside the browser, enabling server-side scripting.
- Node.js runs on various operating systems including **Windows**, **Linux**, and more.
- It features an **event-driven architecture** capable of **asynchronous** processing.
- Node.js was developed by **Ryan Dahl** in 2009.

## History of Node.js

- Wherever there is Node.js, there must be a **JavaScript engine** (such as V8).
# Node.js Timeline

### 2009
- **Ryan Dahl** started the development of Node.js.
- Initially started on **Firefox** (SpiderMonkey engine) but switched to **Google Chrome** (V8 engine) after two days.
- The original name was **web.js** (for creating web servers), later renamed to **Node.js** after realizing its potential.
- **Joyent** became a key supporter, with Ryan Dahl joining them.
- The main motivation was to create a **non-blocking server**, unlike the existing Apache HTTP Server, to handle multiple requests with fewer threads.

### 2010
- **npm** (Node Package Manager) was created by **Isaac Z. Schlueter**.
- npm became the package registry for Node.js, supporting both **macOS** and **Linux**.

### 2011
- Node.js introduced support for **Windows**.
- Node.js started gaining popularity for its asynchronous, event-driven architecture.

### 2012
- **Ryan Dahl** left the Node.js core team, and **Isaac Z. Schlueter** became the new lead developer.
- The pace of Node.js development began to slow down under Joyent's stewardship.

### 2014
- **Fedor Indutny** forked Node.js to create **io.js** due to frustrations with the slow pace of Node.js development.

### 2015
- Node.js Foundation was founded by **Joyent** to support the continued development of Node.js.
- **io.js** and Node.js were merged under the Node.js Foundation.
- The **OpenJS Foundation** was later established, encompassing Node.js and other JavaScript projects.

### 2019
- Node.js celebrated its 10th anniversary and continued to thrive under the OpenJS Foundation.
